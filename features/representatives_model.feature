Feature: Display a representative's profile page
  As a researcher,
  I want to be able to search for a state's representatives and access their information
  so that I can write a biography 
#Scenario:
#  Given that Joseph Biden in database
#  When I search California 
#  When I follow "Joseph R. Biden"
#  Then I should see "Democratic Party"
#  Then I should see "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, Washington, DC 20500"
